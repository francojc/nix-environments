# Teaching ideas

# Overview

This document contains a collection of teaching ideas and activities that can be used in a variety of educational settings. These ideas are designed to engage students, promote critical thinking, and enhance learning outcomes. They can be adapted to suit different subjects, grade levels, and learning styles.

These activities, however, are geared towards smaller class sizes (between 15-22 students). Some activities may need to be modified for the type of class you are teaching. For example, a language class may require more group work and pair work activities, while a lecture-based class may require more discussion-based activities, depending on the subject matter and level of the students.

# Course particular considerations

## FYS "The Good Life: Exploring Global Perspectives"

### Class strategies

- Relate the themes of the book to the students' lives. Bring/ share something that represents these themes.
- Have students keep a "Good Life" passport where they record their reflections on the book and the discussions we have in class. Comparing and contrasting their own values and experiences with those of the people/ cultures in the book.
- Have students create a "Good Life" map where they chart their own path to the good life.
- Adopt and practice some form of self-betterment during the semester and have students reflect on how it impacts their well-being. (journaling, meditation, exercise, etc.)
- Have students create a "Good Life" vision board where they collect images, quotes, and ideas that represent their vision of the good life.
